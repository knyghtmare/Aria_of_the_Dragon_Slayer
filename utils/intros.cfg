As the retinue flew over it, they saw that it was actually the border of an immense caldera. Inside it, through the thick smoke rising from the ground, Tenma could see the silhouettes of huge towers, each of them capable of sheltering at least ten drakes as large as Veshtar Joohn, all made of dark volcanic rock. The drakes landed about three kilometres into the crater; for, as the Mother Queen explained, as long as they were on the ruins of Aghayu, not even the skies would be safe..."

However, it was the couple that urged them all to go to leave; Valerya's students decided to follow Tenma, hoping to find their master again."
